<h2>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing,processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to

<h3>
Data structures are often classified by their characteristics. The following three characteristics are examples:

Linear or non-linear. This characteristic describes whether the data items are arranged in sequential order, such as with an array, or in an unordered sequence, such as with a graph.
Homogeneous or heterogeneous. This characteristic describes whether all data items in a given repository are of the same type. One example is a collection of elements in an array,
or of various types, such as an abstract data type defined as a structure in C or a class specification in Java.
Static or dynamic. This characteristic describes how the data structures are compiled. Static data structures have fixed sizes, structures and memory locations at compile time.
Dynamic data structures have sizes, structures and memory locations that can shrink or expand, depending on the use.
